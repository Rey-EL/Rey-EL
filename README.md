# Hi, I'm Elvis 👋

[cite_start]I am a career investigator and intelligence professional focused on protecting people, information, and institutional trust[cite: 335]. [cite_start]My goal is to serve as a trusted ally in driving a culture where safety, security, and resilience are not just priorities, but shared responsibilities[cite: 276].

[cite_start]I am drawn to cybersecurity because it allows me to combine my investigative work with technology to detect threats, strengthen defenses, and protect mission integrity[cite: 338]. [cite_start]My strengths include investigative precision, solid analytical judgment [cite: 336][cite_start], and practical cybersecurity skills in digital evidence, network operations, and risk analysis[cite: 336].
