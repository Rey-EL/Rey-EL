# Hi, I'm Elvis 👋

I am a career investigator and intelligence professional focused on protecting people, information, and institutional trust. My goal is to serve as a trusted ally in driving a culture where safety, security, and resilience are not just priorities, but shared responsibilities.

I am drawn to cybersecurity because it allows me to combine my investigative work with technology to detect threats, strengthen defenses, and protect mission integrity. My strengths include investigative precision, solid analytical judgment, and practical cybersecurity skills in digital evidence, network operations, and risk analysis.
