  ✦ Hi, I'm Elvis 👋

  As a career investigator and intelligence professional, I am dedicated to protecting people,
  information, and institutional trust. My expertise lies in combining investigative precision with
  robust cybersecurity skills, applying a proactive, data-driven approach to identify threats,
  strengthen defenses, and ensure mission integrity. My bilingual fluency in English and Spanish
  serves as a strategic asset in this mission. This portfolio showcases my practical application of
  these principles.
